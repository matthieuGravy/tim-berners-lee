## Recreating an Existing Website Using HTML and CSS

To take on this exciting challenge, I embarked on the task of recreating an existing website using HTML and CSS. Unfortunately, I didn't manage to complete the entire mockup.

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:matthieuGravy/tim-berners-lee.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd restaurant-css-framework
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run dev
```

## Do I plan to continue the development of this project?
